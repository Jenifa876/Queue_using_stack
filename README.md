# # Stack-Based Queue Implementation in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a queue using two stacks. The code allows for basic queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, checking if the queue is empty or full, and peeking at the front element.

## Features

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- **Peek**: View the front element of the queue without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
- **isFull**: Check if the queue is full.
- **Print**: Display all elements in the queue.
